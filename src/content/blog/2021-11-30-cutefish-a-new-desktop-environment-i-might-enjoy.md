**UPDATE 2023-11-9:** This project seems to be discontinued

There's a new kid on the block. A new DE based on KDE and heavily inspired by MacOS, [Cutefish](https://en.cutefishos.com/). For the first time in a while I have found myself reconsidering leaving Gnome as my main DE and make the switch to a KDE based one.

To be fair, Cutefish has what I like about Gnome, a limited amount of customizations to avoid being overwhelmed, a very aesthetic environment and a just works approach to increase productivity.

I don't mind that it is so MacOS alike due to I'm also a MacOS user myself. In fact I like that and I'm used to the **top panel with global menus and a dock**.

Cutefish and its OS CutefishOS are **still in the early stages of development**, so it is not ready for production or to become my daily driver. For example, there are no multiple desktops or gestures, and those for my are deal breakers for now, but I'll keep an eye on this beautiful little fish.
