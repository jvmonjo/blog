In a few days Apple will be releasing the 17.4 version of iOS. It will be a huge update if we take into account that Apple has been forced to comply with the [DMA](https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/index_en) in the European Union. Apple will (sort of) comply with it, but it won’t be with their engineers but with their army of lawyers.

The obligation of opening iOS to other browser engines has been used as an excuse to kill Progressive Web Apps (PWA) in Europe. If we, as Apple users and Europeans, don’t raise our voices we will be telling Apple that we are ok with that, and I am not.

I want an open web and I want to be able to develop web apps that have the same experience wherever they are executed. We already have that and shouldn't allow Apple to take it away from us.

European authorities should take action against this and they shouldn’t allow this kind of behavior. The open web is at stake again.
